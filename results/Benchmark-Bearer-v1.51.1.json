This issue arises because some regular expressions can be processed with exponential time complexity. When attackers exploit this, it can significantly drain CPU resources, effectively causing a denial of service.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do** validate all dynamic and user-supplied input against a strict safelist of allowed characters before using it in regular expressions. This step helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious patterns.\n- **Do** restrict the length of input that can be processed. Limiting input size is a straightforward way to mitigate many ReDoS vulnerabilities.\n- **Do** implement timeouts for regular expression evaluation to avoid excessive resource consumption. This can be achieved using JavaScript environments or libraries that allow setting execution time limits.\n- **Do** simplify complex regular expressions to reduce the risk of catastrophic backtracking. Breaking down expressions into simpler parts makes them safer and more manageable.\n- **Do not** directly concatenate user input into regular expressions. This practice can introduce unsafe patterns and lead to vulnerabilities.\n  ```javascript\n  var dynamicRegex = new RegExp('^' + userInput); // unsafe\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)","documentation_url":"https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/javascript_lang_dynamic_regex","line_number":62,"full_filename":"/benchmark/templates/js/testsuiteutils.js","filename":"templates/js/testsuiteutils.js","source":{"start":62,"end":62,"column":{"start":24,"end":59}},"sink":{"start":62,"end":62,"column":{"start":24,"end":59},"content":""},"parent_line_number":62,"fingerprint":"467c8f914710fde6e4866b9bf39a2f48_0","old_fingerprint":"5d5a6e1aa23b6cae8919db97acf78a6c_0","code_extract":"    return str.replace(new RegExp(escapeRegExp(find), 'g'), replace);","severity":"medium"},{"cwe_ids":["1004"],"id":"python_django_cookie_missing_http_only","title":"Missing HTTP Only option in cookie configuration","description":"## Description\n\nNot setting the HTTP Only attribute to \"true\" in cookie configurations leaves the cookie vulnerable to being accessed by client-side JavaScript.
